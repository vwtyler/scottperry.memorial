Scott was a loving son, brother, husband, father, grandfather and friend for 71 years. Born July 26,1953 in Macon, Georgia to Earl Cranston (Jr.) and Mary Ann (Bartlett) Perry, he attended Bonaire Elementary and Warner Robins High schools and would reunite with classmates for reunions through the years. As a young child, Scott enjoyed playing pranks and building treehouses with friends and siblings Rodney, Marguerite and Michael. As a teenager, he began playing drums and, with friends, formed the Prince of Whales, a band that played in clubs around Middle Georgia.

As an adult, Scott’s journey led him to Atlanta for work and to enjoy the attractions of a big city. He added life-long friends wherever he went due to his fun-loving, accepting personality. After meeting his future wife, Molly McPhillamy, he initiated their purchase of a 16’ Hobie Cat, and they spent weekends camping and sailing on Lake Lanier and the Florida Gulf Coast. Scott and Molly married in April 1983 and made their home in Decatur, GA neighborhoods.

At the age of 34, Scott was diagnosed with a brain tumor and underwent radiation treatment at Emory University Hospital. His tight knit friends and family gathered around to support him and donated money so he and Molly could take a trip to England and Scotland. He later enjoyed travelling to Italy and road tripping across the U.S. Although the tumor never recurred post-treatment, Scott experienced ongoing physical and mental challenges that left him with permanent disabilities.

Self-employed in the flooring business for several years, Scott eventually owned and operated a retail floor covering shop in Norcross, GA. He loved classic cars and throughout his life owned several sportscars and later an Aprilia moped that he used for short jaunts around town. Scott also enjoyed Atlanta sports and always relished an opportunity to see the Falcons and Braves play.

In 1992, Scott was thrilled when his daughter, Grace Elizabeth, was born. He did his best as a stay-at-home dad and spent many years chauffeuring Grace to and from school with friends. He became a regular at the Toco Hills Dunkin’ Donuts, earning him a spot in the Hole in the Donut Gang, and spent afternoons catching up with old friends on the phone. He could recall old memories with ease and loved telling stories from the past. Even though his hearing was compromised throughout his life, he continued to get great enjoyment from listening to music and seeing live shows.

Scott and Molly moved to Sonora, California in 2021 to be near their daughter and future son-in-law. He enjoyed drives in the Sierra Foothills and spending more time with his growing family. While his health declined, he was determined to walk Grace down the aisle at her 2023 wedding to Tyler Jackson in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Scott cherished visits from his granddaughter, Birdie Anne, and the companionship of his dog, Loki, in the last months of life.

Scott had an insatiable sweet tooth, loved Coca Cola and unfailingly spoke to strangers. Despite his early and later health setbacks, he always appreciated the simple enjoyment of living. His legacy reminds us to hold our loved ones close and remain devoted to our family and friends.
